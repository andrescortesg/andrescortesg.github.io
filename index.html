			<p>Hi, I'm Andres, a programmer from Colombia, 
			and I'm a web developer that likes to tinker 
			with new and interesting technologies</p>
			<p>I am a man of few words, that loves 
			to just make things happen, and I seriously
			am struggling to even write things for things
			for my portfolio so I'll just start rambling
			about random things.</p>
